# Episode 5: Automated Deobfuscation!

In this [episode](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/361931366), we continue our work removing obfuscation techniques in an obfuscated binary. We moved on from attacking push->ret style obfuscation, and moved on to implementing a variation of opaque predicate removal!

In the next episode, we'll work on running our first two patchers automatically, and then we'll go on the hunt for more obfuscation techniques!
