# Episode 6: Automated Deobfuscation!

In this [episode](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/364544095), we continue our work removing obfuscation techniques in an obfuscated binary. We work on our opaque predicate removal to handle some corner cases, and then we start actually automating things! It doesn't go quite as I planned though, but after the stream I figured out my issues and fixed them, so the provided script is the working version.

In the next episode, we'll iron out some corner cases in our technique and hopefully see some fun automated patching action!
