# Episode 3: Architecture Plugin!

In this shorter [episode](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/358962183), I decided to try to build a simple `Architecture` plugin in about 1.5 hours. Our target was a [simple VM crackme](https://www.malwaretech.com/vm1) from MalwareTech's site.

The resulting disassembler and lifter can be found [here](vm_arch.py), and an annotated bndb file is [here](vm1.bndb).

We didn't actually solve the crackme, though, so I've left that as an exercise to the reader!
