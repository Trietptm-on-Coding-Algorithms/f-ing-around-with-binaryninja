# Episode 4: Emulator, and Deobfuscation!

In this [episode](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/366032780), we revisited last episode's VMArch `Architecture` plugin, and then implemented a simple emulator to solve the challenge for us.

After that, we started looking at an obfuscated binary to see if we can automate some, if not all, of the deobfuscation process. We're off to a good start, so look for the results of that code in Episode 5!
